# legacy-source
cheat for the legacy build of cs:go (pre-desync)

first off, no this is not actual styles lmao
i called it that as a joke because i didn't know what else to call it

this is pasted from stickrpghook legacy, honestly not that bad

credits:
first i have to give credits to stickrpg for this, it would've never been possible without it
next, credits to bolbi, i took his antiaims from bameware and added them into this
after that, credits for different things in the resolver
i took shit from supremacy, fatality, kiduahook, stackhack, and used my own brain to make this premium ass resolver, not to mention all the stuff that was already in there
  
shit hits huh, still though i would't recommend using this shit because supremacy pastes and basically any other paste almost hits better than this because they have an animfix lmao
i'm too lazy to add one, maybe ill do it at some point and update this who knows though
